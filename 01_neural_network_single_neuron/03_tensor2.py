"""
Concept:
Reinforces tensor operations and introduces extracting a single prediction using .item().

Purpose: 
Shows students how to work with specific outputs and reinforces tensor shapes, preparing them for more complex operations.

Teaching Approach:
Explain: 
Remind students that this script does the same math as tensor1.py. Explain .item() as a way to get a single number from a tensor (e.g., y_pred[1].item() gets 100.4).

Activity: 
Run tensor2.py and compare its output to tensor1.py. Uncomment the print(b.shape) and print(X1.shape) lines to show tensor shapes (e.g., b is a scalar, X1 is a vector of size 4).

Code Focus: 
Highlight y_pred[1].item() and discuss why we might want a single prediction.

Engagement: 
Ask students to extract a different prediction (e.g., y_pred[2].item()) and verify it matches their manual calculation.


Why this order? Itâ€™s a small step from tensor1.py, adding one new concept (.item()) while reinforcing tensors. It keeps the focus on familiar math.
