### Summary

This introduces the foundational concepts of machine learning, focusing on the idea of a **model** and preparing to explore the **neuron**, the basic building block of a neural network. Here’s a concise breakdown for learning deep learning:

1. **What is a Model?**
   - A **model** is like a math machine that learns from data to make predictions. It’s the core of machine learning.
   - Example: If you want to predict someone’s house price based on its size, the model learns how size affects price.

2. **Training Data:**
   - **Training data** is the information the model learns from, like examples or practice problems.
   - It’s made up of **features**, which are important pieces of the data.
     - Example: In a table of house data, features could be size, number of bedrooms, or location. In an image, each pixel could be a feature.

3. **Training Process:**
   - **Training** is when the model studies the training data to learn **parameters** (like internal settings, e.g., slope and intercept in a line equation).
   - The model adjusts these parameters to **fit** the data, meaning it tries to make its predictions match the actual results as closely as possible.

4. **Inference (Making Predictions):**
   - After training, the model is used for **inference**, which means applying it to new, unseen data to make **predictions**.
   - Example: A trained model could predict the price of a new house based on its size.

5. **Neural Networks and Neurons:**
   - Here we will focus on **neurons** (the simplest unit of a neural network) and **neural networks**, which are popular models in machine learning.
   - Other machine learning models exist, but neural networks are widely used today (e.g., for image recognition or chatbots).

### Why This Matters
This sets up the key terms (model, training data, features, parameters, training, inference, predictions) you’ll use when learning about neurons and neural networks. It’s like learning the rules of a game before playing it! Understanding these basics helps you see how a neural network learns and makes predictions, which you’ll explore with code like the Python scripts you’ve seen.
