The order builds from basics to advanced, preventing overwhelm:

01_first_steps.ipynb: Starts with Python/Jupyter fundamentals for confidence.
02_pandas-bak.ipynb: Introduces Pandas cleaning.
03_pandas3.ipynb: Reinforces cleaning with printing.
04_pandas.ipynb: Adds histograms for visual data understanding.
05_pandas2.ipynb: Introduces scatter plots to explore relationships.
06_problem.py: Standalone data prep script, bridging to models.
07_exercise.ipynb: Feature engineering, applying cleaning.
08_neuron.py: Basic neuron setup without training.
09_neuron2.py: Adds training, shows slow convergence issues.
10_neuron_normalized.py: Introduces partial normalization to fix issues.
11_neuron_normalized2.py: Full normalization for effective training.
12_visualizing_loss.py: Builds on normalized training by adding loss collection and plotting, teaching how to monitor/debug.
13_model_saving.py: Teaches saving after visualizing good training.
14_model_loading.py: Shows reuse, closing the cycle.
15_exercise_solution.py: Extends with features for creativity.

This progression emphasizes data (cleaning/viz) before modeling, then training/debugging (with new loss viz), and finally deployment/improvement. "visualizing_loss.py" fits after full normalization to visualize successful training.
