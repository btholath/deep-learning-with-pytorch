# Spam Detection Techniques

 key techniques like vectorization, model validation, and performance evaluation

 Why is it important to convert a sparse matrix to a dense format before using it in PyTorch models?

PyTorch requires dense formats for certain operations that sparse formate cannot support.

What is the significance of the max_features parameter in the Count Vectorizer tool?

It limits the number of most frequent words considered
"max_features" restricts the vocabulary size to the top N most frequent words, helping to focus model training on the most relevant data.

How does the sigmoid activation function affect the output of a spam detection model?
It maps the model's output to a probability scale betweeb 0 and 1, indicating the likehood of spam
