1. Single neuron first → students grasp weights, bias, logits, sigmoid, loss.
2. Sequential small nets → concrete upgrade: hidden layers & activations.
3. Swap activations → see how one line changes training dynamics.
4. Optimizers (Adam) → speed & stability improvements feel real.
5. Mini-batches → how pros train on real datasets.
6. Epoch tracking → good habits for reading training curves.
7. Train/Val → scientific thinking: fair testing.
8. Manual two-layer → demystify what Sequential automates.
