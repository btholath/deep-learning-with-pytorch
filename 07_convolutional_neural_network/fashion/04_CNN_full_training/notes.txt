ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize clothing
         from the Fashion-MNIST dataset (like T-shirts, shoes, bags).

Real-Life Example:
ðŸ‘‰ Online stores (Amazon, Flipkart) use CNNs to auto-tag product images
   (shirt, sneaker, dress).

# 1) DEVICE SETUP: CPU or GPU
# 2) LOAD DATASET: Fashion-MNIST (clothing images, 28x28 grayscale)
    # Mini-batches of 32 images
# 3) BUILD THE MODEL: CNN with multiple layers
    # ðŸ”Ž First block: find simple patterns (edges, corners)
    # ðŸ”Ž Second block: find complex shapes (sleeves, soles)
    # ðŸ§  Fully connected decision-making layers
# 4) LOSS + OPTIMIZER
# 5) TRAINING LOOP
# 6) TEST ACCURACY
