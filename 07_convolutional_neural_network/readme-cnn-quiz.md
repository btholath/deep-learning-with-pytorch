# Convolutional Neural Networks, challenges of the Fashion MNIST dataset and edge detection using the Sobel operator. 
# Understand how CNNs process image data, why Fashion MNIST is more complex and how the Sobel operator works.

How does a Convolutional Neural Network treat image data differently from traditional neural networks?
CNNs maintain the spatial hierarchy and structure of image data
CNNs are specifically designed to understand the two-dimensional structure of images, 
recognizing spatial hierarchies and relationships, which is critical for processing images more effectively than traditional neural networks.


What makes the Fashion MNIST dataset more challenging compared to the original MNIST dataset?
The Fashion MNIST dataset contains images of various fashion items, which are more complex and variable than the handwritten digits.
Fashion items in the dataset present a greater challenge due to their varied and complex shapes compared to simple digits.

What is the primary use of the Sobel operator in computer vision?
To detect edges by highlighting changes in brightness across pixels
The Sobel operator is used for edge detection. It works by identifying areas of high contrast in an image, which typically indicate edges.
